Under the background of the continuous development of the information age, the content based
on words grows exponentially, making it more challenging to manage this large-scale information.
This information could be processed manually in the past. However, now, it is impossible because
of the asymmetry between the amount of data and the ability to process information manually,
which exemplifies the efforts to handle the current data scales, thereby promoting the development
of automatic key sentence and keyphrase extraction methods that use the mighty computing power
of computers to replace the manual labor [1]. Keyphrase extraction and key sentence extraction are
two important subtasks in the text generation task [2–5]. Among them, the key sentence extraction
task separates the most important part of a text and combines it in a specific way to an abstract that
can express the text’s main content while retaining the readability [6]. The main task of keyphrase
extraction is to identify a single word or phrase representing the text’s main content [7]. The extracted
results are called keyphrases, the most common of which include the keyword in the abstracts of
academic papers, representing the core content that the author wants to express. As the concise
expression of an article’s main idea, keyphrase makes the information easy to be managed, classified,
and retrieved [8]. At present, keyphrase extraction is widely used in many fields, such as natural
language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) [9–12], opinion mining [13–15], document
indexing [16], and document classification [17].
